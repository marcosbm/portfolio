I always try to learn something new. I think this is because I do not code just for money or work, especially I do it for hobby because I love it. \n\nI can develop both frontend and backend using BFF, microservices or GraphQL. Now I am delving into Java development with Spring and Javascript with React and Angular. I am learning languages ​​like PHP and Python with frameworks like Laravel, Wordpress and Django. \nI am also preparing for the Oracle OCA Java 8 certification",
